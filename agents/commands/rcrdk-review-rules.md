# Review branch changes against project rules

When this command runs, audit **all files changed on the current branch** (including already-committed changes) against the project's coding rules. Produce a fix summary only — **do not implement**, **do not create docs**, **do not commit**, **do not push**.

## Goal

Find rule violations, missing tests, structural mismatches, and convention drift in branch work before merge. End with a concise action list grouped by file or concern.

## Hard boundaries

1. **Read-only review** in this phase — no file edits, no commits, no new markdown/docs.
2. Do **not** auto-fix or auto-implement after the summary.
3. Do **not** run package installs or change dependencies.
4. After the summary, **stop and ask** whether to proceed with implementation.

## Discover project rules

Load rules in this order (prefer repo-local sources):

1. `agents/rules/*.mdc` (source of truth; `.cursor/rules` is a symlink)
2. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
3. `.cursorrules`, `agents/commit-messages.cursorrules`
4. ESLint / Prettier / commitlint config when they encode conventions not covered above

Build a mental checklist keyed by file kind:

| File kind                        | Primary rules                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/utils/**`                   | utility-functions, functional-programming, typescript, type-imports, project-structure, constants-and-variables, deduplication |
| `src/hooks/**`                   | hooks, react-query (if applicable), typescript, type-imports                                                                   |
| `src/app/**/*.tsx` (components)  | react-components, component-member-order, constants-and-variables, control-flow, project-structure                             |
| `src/contexts/**`                | contexts, typescript                                                                                                           |
| `src/schemas/**`                 | schemas, typescript                                                                                                            |
| `src/http/**`                    | http-layer, type-imports                                                                                                       |
| `src/app/_actions/**`            | server-actions, validated-actions                                                                                              |
| `src/types/**`                   | typescript, type-imports                                                                                                       |
| `**/*.spec.*`, `**/__tests__/**` | test-approach, test-naming-and-structure, test-organization, test-mocks, test-element-selection                                |
| barrel `index.ts`                | barrel-exports, imports                                                                                                        |

Apply **alwaysApply** rules to every changed file (imports, strict-equality, optional-chaining, array-access, naming-conventions, etc.).

## Discover branch changes

1. Run in parallel:
   - `git branch --show-current`
   - `git merge-base HEAD main` (fallback: `master`, then `origin/main`, then `origin/master`)
   - `git diff --name-status <merge-base>..HEAD`
   - `git diff <merge-base>..HEAD` (full diff for context)
   - `git status` (include unstaged/untracked on top of branch diff)
2. Include **all paths** from the branch diff plus any **uncommitted** changes not yet on the branch.
3. Skip binary-only or generated artifacts unless the user cares about them; note skipped paths briefly.
4. Do **not** commit staged/unstaged files as part of this command.

## Review procedure

For each changed file:

1. Identify file kind and load the relevant rule subset.
2. Read the **current file content** (not only the diff) when needed for context.
3. Flag concrete violations with:
   - **File** and **line/area** (function, export, JSX block)
   - **Rule** (rule file or convention name)
   - **Problem** (what is wrong today)
   - **Suggested fix** (specific, minimal change)
4. Also check cross-cutting concerns:
   - Logic duplicated across changed files → deduplication
   - Business logic in `src/app/` that belongs in `src/utils/` → project-structure
   - Missing barrel export when a new util/hook is added
   - Missing tests for new/changed util, hook, or non-trivial component behavior
   - Type-only imports not using `import type`
   - `function` exports in utils instead of `const` arrow
   - Component helpers that should be extracted utils
   - Test files mixed into production commits (informational only — do not rewrite history)

Prefer **actionable** findings over nitpicks. Skip style issues Prettier/ESLint already auto-fix on commit unless they would fail CI.

Optional verification (run only when useful, not mandatory):

- `pnpm typecheck` scoped or full if types look risky
- Targeted `pnpm test <path>` for changed modules with new behavior
- `pnpm lint` on changed paths if rule violations are ambiguous

Do not block the summary on long full-suite runs.

## Output format

End with this structure:

```text
## Branch review (<branch> vs <base>)

**Files reviewed:** N
**Findings:** N (X must-fix, Y should-fix, Z nice-to-have)

### Must fix
- `path/to/file.ts`: <problem> — <rule> — <suggested fix>

### Should fix
- ...

### Nice to have
- ...

### Missing tests
- `path/to/module.ts`: <what to cover>

### Clean / no issues
- `path/to/file.ts` (optional — only when explicitly verified)

### Skipped
- <path>: <reason>

### Open questions
- <id or short label>: <what is ambiguous> — options: A) … B) … C) …
```

Use **Open questions** when a finding has multiple valid fixes, behavior is unclear, or the review cannot recommend one path without a product/engineering decision. Do not bury ambiguity inside suggested fixes — surface it here.

Severity guide:

- **Must fix** — violates a hard project rule, likely CI failure, or clear bug/convention break
- **Should fix** — convention drift, maintainability, missing tests for new logic
- **Nice to have** — minor consistency; safe to defer

If no issues: say so explicitly and list what was reviewed.

## After the summary

**Stop.** Ask exactly:

> Should I continue and implement these fixes?

Do not start edits until the user confirms.

### When the user confirms without details

Treat as confirmation without details: bare **yes**, **y**, **continue**, **go ahead**, **implement**, or similar with no scope or option specified.

Before editing, check whether the summary has any **Open questions** (or equivalent ambiguity called out in Must fix / Should fix / Missing tests).

**If there are open questions:**

1. Do **not** implement yet.
2. Resolve questions **one at a time, in summary order** — never batch multiple open questions in a single message.
3. For the **first** unanswered question only:
   - Present **numbered options** (what you could do). Use the AskQuestion tool when available (single question per call); otherwise list options clearly in chat.
   - Each option should be concrete and mutually exclusive where possible, e.g.:
     - A) Keep current behavior; add test documenting it
     - B) Change behavior to fall back to `developmentCard` when filtered gallery is empty
     - C) Skip this item for now
4. **Stop and wait** for the user's answer. Do not ask the next question in the same turn.
5. After each answer, record the chosen option, then ask the **next** unanswered question the same way.
6. Repeat steps 3–5 until every open question has an answer.
7. Only then implement the confirmed scope (Must fix / Should fix + resolved choices).

**If there are no open questions:** proceed with all Must fix and Should fix items. Skip Nice to have unless the user included them in their reply.

### Implementation rules (after scope is clear)

Apply fixes in small focused edits (same conventions as the review). Still without committing unless they ask separately (e.g. `/rcrdk-commit-unstaged`).

If the user confirms with **partial** scope (e.g. "only must-fix", "skip nice-to-have", "option B only"), follow that scope exactly.
