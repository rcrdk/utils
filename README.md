## ðŸ§ª How to convert an entire folder of images to WEBP format
I was having trouble and wasting my time by converting file by file in command line. This script could help you too:  

### Requirements:
- This script works on Unix based systems such as MacOS and Linux.
- You'll need `cwebp` command available.

### Steps:
1. Download `webp-convert-directory.sh`;
2. Open terminal;
3. Access folder containing images;
4. Run `sh [file_path]`. You can drag and drop file to terminal to get full path:
   - Example: `sh /Users/ricardo/Desktop/webp-convert-directory.sh`
5. And voilÃ ! All files converted!
